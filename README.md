# bioIT

Things you need:

- Working LINUX environment (i.e. an ubuntu VM)
- Python installation with pip (ubuntu includes this usually)
- Download jupyter notebook (in console: pip install notebook)
- Run the notebook (in console: jupyter notebook)
- -> click on the "Bioinformatics ipynb from the jupyter notebook list that should pop up in your browser)

### Have fun :)

This is what the console should display when starting the notebook, and usually a browser opens, but you can also
open it by clicking on the link provided in the console

The notebook works as follows:
You have on top in the center the button "Run"
This executes the selected cell and either renders markdown (which is already rendered) or executes the code bits written within.
Feel free to do this in an IDE or run in some other way, but I think python notebooks are a neat tool to share/teach.

So to run a certain code fragment, click on it (select it) and press the run button above in the center!
